 * Specialized Thread class aimed at xpocketmc-MP-related usages. It handles setting up autoloading and error handling.

 * Note: You probably don't need a thread unless you're doing something in it that's expected to last a long time (or
 * indefinitely).
 * For CPU-demanding tasks that take a short amount of time, consider using AsyncTasks instead to make better use of the
 * CPU.
